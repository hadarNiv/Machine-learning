The analysis in the project was conducted as part of a Machine Learning 2 course, and the data was taken from a government website. It concerns a satisfaction survey conducted in several hospitals by the Ministry of Health. The survey examines the demographic characteristics of the patients, such as gender and age, as well as their feelings regarding various measures related to the care they received, such as the doctors' attitude and the cleanliness of the rooms.

The goal was to perform an analysis to classify the patient groups into three categories: very satisfied, satisfied, and dissatisfied. The project was divided into two parts: supervised learning and unsupervised learning. In the supervised learning part, the analysis aimed to identify the characteristics of the patients and what aspects bothered them the most. This was done in order to recommend to hospital managers the areas that need improvement.

In the unsupervised part, we tried to categorize the patients to understand which factors were most problematic for them.

The project made use of several models, and comparisons were made between them based on various metrics. We recommend focusing on the elderly population, chronic patients, expanding hospital departments, and improving the efficiency of patient intake and discharge, based on the results of the project.
